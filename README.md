# react-native-weather-app
This is a Simple Weather Application which displays any city's weather worldwide. Users can enter any city in the search bar, and the openweathermap api will fetch the weather data for that location and render it on the user's screen.



## Purpose

I have developed this project as a pet project for enhancing my React native and mobile development skills and i would hope the same for anyone reading or landing on this project.
